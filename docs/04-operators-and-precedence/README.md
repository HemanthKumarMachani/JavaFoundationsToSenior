# 04 – Operators and Operator Precedence

Operators define how values are computed and compared in Java.
While they look simple, most subtle bugs and interview traps
come from misunderstanding operator behavior and precedence.

This module covers:
- Arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators
- Short-circuit evaluation
- Increment/decrement behavior
- Operator precedence rules
- Common OCP and interview traps

You should be able to:
✔ Predict exact execution order  
✔ Explain why certain expressions behave unexpectedly  
✔ Avoid short-circuit and precedence bugs  
✔ Solve tricky operator-based interview questions
