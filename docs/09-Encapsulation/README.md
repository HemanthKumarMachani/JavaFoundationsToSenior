# 09 – Encapsulation & Access Modifiers

Encapsulation is about protecting object state and controlling how data changes.

This module explains:
- What encapsulation really means (beyond "private fields")
- How access modifiers shape API boundaries
- Why exposing internal state is dangerous
- How immutability strengthens encapsulation
- Defensive copying and protecting mutable state

Why this matters for senior engineers:
- Prevents subtle bugs
- Protects business invariants
- Improves maintainability
- Enables safe concurrency
- Avoids tight coupling between modules

After this module, you should be able to:
✔ Design classes with strong invariants  
✔ Explain access levels clearly  
✔ Identify broken encapsulation  
✔ Implement immutable classes safely  
✔ Answer encapsulation interview questions confidently
