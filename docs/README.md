# 06 – Classes & Objects

Classes and objects form the backbone of Java's object-oriented model.
Understanding how objects are created, initialized, and managed
is essential for writing correct, maintainable, and testable code.

This module covers:
- Class structure and object creation
- Constructors and constructor chaining
- The `this` keyword
- Static vs instance members
- Object initialization order
- Common interview and OCP traps

You should be able to:
✔ Explain how objects are created in memory  
✔ Describe constructor execution order  
✔ Correctly use `this` and `static`  
✔ Predict initialization behavior  
✔ Answer class-related interview questions confidently
