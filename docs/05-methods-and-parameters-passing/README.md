# 05 – Methods & Parameter Passing

Methods define behavior, contracts, and reusability in Java.
Understanding how Java resolves method calls is critical for:
- Writing clean APIs
- Debugging subtle bugs
- Explaining behavior in interviews
- Clearing OCP-style questions

This module covers:
- Method structure and stack frames
- Parameter passing rules
- Method overloading and resolution
- Varargs behavior
- Common interview and OCP traps

You should be able to:
✔ Explain how method calls work at runtime  
✔ Predict which overloaded method is invoked  
✔ Explain pass-by-value clearly  
✔ Avoid varargs and overloading pitfalls  
✔ Answer tricky method-resolution interview questions
