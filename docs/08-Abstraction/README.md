# 08 – Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of exposing only **what a system does**
and hiding **how it does it**.

This module explains:
- Why abstraction exists in Java
- How abstract classes and interfaces differ in intent and behavior
- How abstraction enables extensibility, testing, and loose coupling
- How the JVM treats abstract methods and interface methods
- Common abstraction-related interview traps

Why this matters for senior engineers:
- Frameworks (Spring, Hibernate, JPA) are built on abstraction
- Clean architecture depends on correct abstraction boundaries
- Poor abstraction leads to rigid, fragile systems
- Interviewers use abstraction to test design thinking, not syntax

After this module, you should be able to:
✔ Explain abstraction without using buzzwords  
✔ Decide when to use an abstract class vs an interface  
✔ Explain how abstraction enables polymorphism and decoupling  
✔ Avoid over-abstraction and premature abstraction  
✔ Answer abstraction questions clearly in interviews
