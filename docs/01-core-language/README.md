# 01 - Core Language

This module covers the heart of the Java language:
- Program structure
- Variables and memory
- Primitive vs reference types
- String handling and immutability
- Wrapper classes, autoboxing, equals/hashCode traps
- `final` keyword and value vs reference semantics

These concepts form the foundation for everything else in Java.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
✔ Explain how Java stores and passes values  
✔ Avoid common interview traps involving autoboxing and `==`  
✔ Understand why String is immutable and how the pool works  
✔ Write cleaner, safer, more predictable Java code  
✔ Answer OCP certification questions in this area
