# 02 – Control Flow and Operators

This module explains how Java executes logic:
- Conditional execution
- Branching
- Looping
- Modern switch expressions (Java 12+)

This section is critical for:
- Writing correct business logic
- Understanding fall-through bugs
- Explaining code behavior in interviews
- Clearing OCP-style trick questions

You should be able to explain:
- Difference between switch statement and switch expression
- Why fall-through happens
- When loops cause bugs or infinite execution
