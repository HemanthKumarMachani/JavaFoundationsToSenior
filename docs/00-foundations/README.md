# 00 – Foundations

This module builds the mental model for **how Java actually runs your code**.

It covers:

- What JDK, JRE, and JVM are and how they relate
- How a `.java` file becomes a running program
- High-level view of JVM memory and execution

You should be able to confidently answer in an interview:

- “What happens when I run `java Main`?”
- “What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?”
- “Where does Java code run: on the OS or inside the JVM?”
