# 07 – Inheritance & Polymorphism

Inheritance and polymorphism define how Java enables code reuse,
behavior specialization, and runtime flexibility.

This module explains:
- What inheritance really means at runtime
- How Java resolves method calls (compile-time vs runtime)
- The difference between overriding, hiding, and overloading
- How `super`, `final`, and `abstract` affect inheritance
- Why polymorphism exists and when it becomes dangerous

Why this matters for senior engineers:
- Frameworks rely heavily on polymorphism (Spring, Hibernate)
- Many bugs come from incorrect assumptions about method dispatch
- Interviewers test your understanding of runtime behavior, not syntax

You should be able to:
✔ Explain dynamic dispatch step by step  
✔ Predict which method executes and why  
✔ Explain why fields are not polymorphic  
✔ Avoid inheritance-related design pitfalls  
✔ Clearly explain overriding rules in interviews
